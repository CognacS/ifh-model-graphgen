    which is copied to avoid dependencies from torchvision. It has been readapted
    to be more similar to torch.nn.functional.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits

    Args:
        input (Tensor): A float tensor of arbitrary shape.
                The predictions for each example.
        target (Tensor): A float tensor with the same shape as inputs. Stores the binary
                classification label for each element in inputs
                (0 for the negative class and 1 for the positive class).
        alpha (float): Weighting factor in range (0,1) to balance
                positive vs negative examples or -1 for ignore. Default: ``0.25``.
        gamma (float): Exponent of the modulating factor (1 - p_t) to
                balance easy vs hard examples. Default: ``2``.
        reduction (string): ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``
                ``'none'``: No reduction will be applied to the output.
                ``'mean'``: The output will be averaged.
                ``'sum'``: The output will be summed. Default: ``'none'``.
    Returns:
        Loss tensor with the reduction option applied.
